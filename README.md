# Freedom Android App

This repository now contains only the Android application for the Freedom bot experience. The app is implemented with Jetpack Compose and targets Android 6.0 (API 23) to ensure compatibility with legacy devices while preserving Compose functionality through core library desugaring.

For module-specific build instructions, see [`androidApp/README.md`](androidApp/README.md).
